- 👋 Hi, I’m Marry Stephan
- 👀 I’m interested in web development espeiclly on PHP Laravel and am recently learning mobile app development. I have a decade of experience in solution design and sales.
- This is a new profile because my old profile got taken over by my previous organization and GitHub seems to absolutely refuse handing it back to me.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, Flutter and React. I belive the future of tech lies in non-traditional databases and that SQL is about to be killed by Mongo and others so
- I want to equip myself with the tools to remain relevant when that happens.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any kind of web or mobile app development project
- 📫 How to reach me marry@gigalabs.co or marryitstephan@gmail.com
