- 👋 Hi, I’m Marry Stephan
- 👀 I’m interested in web development espeiclly on PHP Laravel and am recently learning mobile app development.
- I have a decade of experience in solution design and sales.
- This is a new profile because my old profile got taken over by my previous organization and GitHub seems to absolutely refuse handing it back to me.
- 🌱 I spent the last two years actively and aggressively learning Java and Python because I could see they would become the most indemand languages very soon and I was bang on with Phython now the most in demand language currently. I have a head-start on the competion but I understand you got to stay sharp or you fall off so I keep practicing and tinkering around with my home server and self deployed and trained LLM which works on just 20GB of DDR4 RAM a basic 16 core CPU and no GPU :-)
- I belive the future of tech lies in non-traditional databases and that SQL is about to be killed by Mongo and others so
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any kind of web or mobile app development project
- 📫 How to reach me sales@virtualworld.live or marryitstephan@gmail.com
